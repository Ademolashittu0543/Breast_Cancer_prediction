# Breast_Cancer_prediction


# Objective

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for breast cancer prediction based on patient diagnostic data. The goal is to classify tumors as benign or malignant using different predictive modeling techniques.

# Dataset

#### The dataset used in this project is a breast cancer dataset containing various diagnostic measurements. Key features include:

>Tumor size-related features (radius, perimeter, area)

>Shape-related features (concavity, concave points, fractal dimension)

>Texture and symmetry-related features

>Diagnosis label (Benign/Malignant) encoded for modeling

# Methods

### Data Preprocessing

>Handled missing values and checked for inconsistencies.

>Encoded categorical variables (e.g., diagnosis column).

>Dropped unnecessary columns (e.g., ID).

>Identified important numerical and categorical features.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

>Visualized feature distributions and relationships.

>Identified key features influencing malignancy.

### Feature Engineering

>Checked for negative values and inconsistencies.

>Scaled features for better model performance.

### Model Selection & Training

>Applied machine learning classifiers, including:

-Logistic Regression

-Decision Trees

-Random Forest

-Support Vector Machine (SVM)

-K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Evaluated the models.

### Dimensionality Reduction

>Applied PCA for feature selection and reducing data dimensionality.

### Model Evaluation & Interpretation

>Used SHAP values to interpret feature importance.

>Analyzed the impact of different features on prediction outcomes.

# Challenges

>Handling class imbalance in the dataset.

>Choosing the most relevant features for prediction.

>Avoiding overfitting while training the models.

>Interpreting the results for better model understanding.

# What I Learned

-Exploratory data analysis and visualization.

-Implementing various classification models.

-Using PCA for dimensionality reduction.

-Model interpretability techniques like SHAP.

-Assessing model performance using multiple evaluation metrics.
